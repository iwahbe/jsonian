;;; Commentary:

;; `jsonian' provides a fully featured `major-mode' to view, navigate and edit JSON files.
;; Notable features include:
;; - `jsonian-path': Display the path to the JSON object at point.
;; - `jsonian-edit-string': Edit the uninterned string at point cleanly in a separate buffer.
;; - `jsonian-enclosing-item': Move point to the beginning of the collection enclosing point.
;; - `jsonian-find': A `find-file' style interface to navigating a JSON document.
;; - Automatic indentation discovery via `jsonian-indent-line'.
;;
;; When `jsonian' is loaded, it adds itself to `auto-mode-alist'.  This will
;; overwrite `javascript-mode' by default when opening a .json file.
;;
;; To have `jsonian-mode' activate when any JSON like buffer is opened,
;; regardless of the extension, add
;;  (add-to-list 'magic-fallback-mode-alist '("^[{[]$" . jsonian-mode))
;; to your config after loading `jsonian'.

;; Manipulating and verifying JSON paths.
;;
;; A JSON Path is a unique identifier for a node in the buffer.  Internally, JSON
;; Paths are lists of strings and integers.  JSON Paths are unique, but multiple
;; string representations may parse into the same JSON Path.  For example
;; 'foo[3].bar' and '["foo"][3]["bar"]' both parse into '("foo" 3 "bar").

(defun jsonian-path (&optional plain pos buffer)
  "Find the JSON path of POINT in BUFFER.
If called interactively, then the path is printed to the
minibuffer and pre-appended to the kill ring.  If called
non-interactively, then the path is returned as a list of strings
and numbers.  It is assumed that BUFFER is entirely JSON and that
the json is valid from POS to `point-min'.  PLAIN indicates that
the path should be formated using only indexes.  Otherwise index
notation is used.

For example
    { \"foo\": [ { \"bar\": █ }, { \"fizz\": \"buzz\" } ] }
with pos at █ should yield \".foo[0].bar\".

`jsonian-path' is optimized to work on very large json files (35 MiB+).
This optimization is achieved by
a. parsing as little of the file as necessary to find the path and
b. leveraging C code whenever possible."
